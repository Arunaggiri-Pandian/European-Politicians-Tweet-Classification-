# European-Politicians-Tweet-Classification-
Classification of Tweets of Politicians from Northern Europe

we explore an extensive dataset from a Kaggle challenge that comprises tweets from general users across seven Northern European countries:
Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands,Norway, and Sweden. 
These tweets, summing up to 509,031 in number, are segmented into a training set (407,223 tweets) and a test set (101,808 tweets). 
Our objective is to harness these tweets to predict the political inclinations of the users. By utilizing various preprocessing methods and implementing a logistic regression model, we navigate the complexities of the dataset to derive meaningful insights. This report outlines our approach, techniques, and results in an easily comprehensible manner
